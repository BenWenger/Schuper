# Timeline

### Hopeful Schedule

I'm scheduling for 18 weeks even though we have more time than that, in case some things take longer than expected.  If I finish early there are extra tasks I can work on.

Complete By | Task | Deliverable
--- | --- | ---
Week 3, Winter | APU Processor, Tracelogger, and virtual memory | Be able to run ‘SPC’ files (APU subunit snapshots) and view a tracelog of the code executed.
Week 4, Winter | APU Audio generation   | Run SPC files and hear the actual music being played.
Week 7, Winter | Main CPU, memory, and tracelogger | Load games and run them, and be able to view a tracelog of the executed CPU instructions.
Week 9, Winter | GPU Simple backgrounds and scrolling | See a title screen for a game
Week 10, Winter | GPU sprites | See an intro demo for a game.
Week 1, Spring | Joypad controls and tying CPU+APU together | Actually be able to play a game and see/hear the game’s output.
Week 2, Spring | GPU color math | See the "translucent" video effects in some games.
Week 3, Spring | Misc CPU raster effects (windows, mosaic) | See these effects in games that use them.
Week 5, Spring | More complicated GPU background modes. | See these modes (Mode7, offset-by-tile) in games that use them.
Week 6, Spring | Other GPU render modes (Hi-res, interleaved, overscan) | See these effects in games that use them.
Week 8, Spring | Improve game compatibility | Take a bunch of games that were broken in the emulator and fix them!
(If I have time) | Simple GUI | Be able to demo the emu with a GUI
(If I have time) | Controller Support | Be able to play games with a PC controller
(probably won’t get to this) | Interactive Debugger | Pause CPU execution and step through code.
