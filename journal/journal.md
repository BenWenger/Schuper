Week | What is completed
--- | ---
Week 2 | APU finished.  Can create a tracelog of the executed SPC code.  Can play actual music!  Wooo!
Week 3 | Main CPU finished, but is untested.  Can't create any tracelogs yet (tracer isn't written), and can't actually run code (no loader)
Week 4 | CPU tracer and loader are complete.  Fixed some CPU bugs in the process.  Super Mario World can load and run code, but it seems to get stuck in a loop shortly into the game, so there must be another CPU bug I'm missing.
Week 5 | CPU bugs fixed. SMW now loads and runs properly and is audible! Also started work on basic PPG/Graphics stuff and the DMA unit.
Week 6 | Some timing stuff touched up.  NMIs/IRQs now should work via an "event" system I have set up.  WAI instruction should also be working.  Started to build the PPU frame but haven't actually rendered anything yet.
Week 7 | todo
