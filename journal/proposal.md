# Proposal


### Programming Project Overview

I want to make a function SNES emulator for Windows, and if time permits, a simple GUI and some debugging functionality.  This project is very interesting to me because I've always been fascinated with emulation, and it will be very exciting to see a program I make run a game that someone else has written. The emulator would draw on many concepts covered in OS, including virtual memory, address translation, and potentially some synchronization issues.  I'll effectively be recreating all the hardware for the SNES in software, so it will require a deep understanding of low level system architecture and behavior. By actually creating a working implementation of these OS concepts, it will greatly help solidify my understanding.
